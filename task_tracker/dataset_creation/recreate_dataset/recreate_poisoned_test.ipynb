Pennsylvania Route 201 passes through Fairhope, leading north to Interstate 70 and south to Fayette City.  As of the 2010 census the population of Fairhope was 1,151.The George H. Williams Townhouses, commonly known as \"The Lawn\" apartments, located in northwest Portland, Oregon, United States, are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  The three-unit townhouse structure was built for, and originally owned by, George Henry Williams, a former United States Attorney General, United States Senator (for Oregon), and Oregon Supreme Court Chief Justice.  Later, Williams also served as mayor of Portland.  The townhouses were built as a business investment, and Williams did not reside in the building.  The structure was moved in 1922.  Although always situated within the block bounded by NW 18th and 19th Avenues, and NW Couch and Davis Streets, it was originally in the block\\'s northwest corner, \"i.e.\" at the southeast corner of the intersection of NW 19th and Davis.  In 1922, it was moved east within the same block, to the corner at NW 18th and Davis.The Upstate is the region in the westernmost part of South Carolina, United States, also known as the Upcountry, which is the historical term.  Although loosely defined among locals, the general definition includes the ten counties of the commerce-rich I-85 corridor in the northwest corner of South Carolina.  This definition coincides with the Greenville–Spartanburg–Anderson, SC Combined Statistical Area, as defined by the Office of Management and Budget in 2015.  The region\\'s population was 1,409,582 as of 2014.  Situated between Atlanta and Charlotte, the Upstate is the fastest-growing region of South Carolina.  After BMW\\'s initial investment, foreign companies, including others from Germany, have a substantial presence in the Upstate; several large corporations have established regional, national, or continental headquarters in the area.
